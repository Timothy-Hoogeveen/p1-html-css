    <h1>HTML Fundamentals</h1>
   <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
  <p>Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. 
    It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of 
    the web. Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.</p>
    <h2>What is a tag?</h2>
    <p>An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between the tags will be displayed per the instructions of the element.</p>
